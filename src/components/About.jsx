          <h2>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m a recent graduate from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison with a deep passion for using technology to solve real-world problems. From tackling complex data challenges to building intuitive applications, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code.
          </p>

          <p>
            My background spans machine learning, data analysis, and full-stack development. I thrive in projects where I can dive into data, uncover insights, and build solutions that make a real impact. Iâ€™m especially drawn to collaborative environments where curiosity and creativity are encouraged.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm currently open to new opportunities â€” whether it's in software engineering, data science, or something unexpected! I'm always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to meaningful work.
